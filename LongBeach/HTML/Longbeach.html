Long Beach in San Vicente is one of the Philippines’ longest white sand beaches  around 14.7 kilometers of unspoiled shore that stretch along San Vicente municipality. It’s praised for its clean sands, calm waters, and relaxed atmosphere, offering peace and space rather than crowded resort vibes. The beach is framed by coconut palms and lush greenery, with rocky cliffs interrupting the shoreline in a few spots. It’s part of an area being developed modestly under eco-tourism guidelines, meaning you’ll find relatively few big commercial establishments, and more small resorts, guesthouses, and local food stalls.            </div>

                    <p class="paragraph" style="color: black;">To enjoy Long Beach best, aim to arrive early in the morning (or late afternoon) to catch sunrise or sunset, when the light is soft and the crowd is minimal. Since the amenities are limited, bring essentials with you (snacks, water, sun protection) and know that many places accept cash only. Renting a motorbike or habal-habal (motorcycle with driver) is a handy way to explore the full stretch of beach and to move between barangays along the shore. Also, check the tide schedule — some parts of the beach are easier to traverse (walking or driving) at certain tides.</p>

                </nav>
                <p>    Expect long, sweeping views of white sand, plenty of space, a gentle breeze, and relatively calm waters. The beach has multiple barangays (villages) along its length, so different sections may feel more remote than others. Some parts have rocky cliffs or rock outcrops interrupting the stretch, but usually, you can walk or explore between them at low tide. Expect rustic charm, not polished luxury — places with comfort but not always high-end amenities. In evenings, you can see spectacular sunsets, and sometimes locals or small vendors gathering for dinner by the beach.</p>

                    <h2>Guide</h2>
                    <p>    Long Beach is accessible from San Vicente town proper — if you fly into San Vicente Airport (SWL), it’s about 10-15 minutes by tricycle or vehicle to reach the beach. If flights aren’t available, you can come from Puerto Princesa by land (van/bus) — 3.5 to 5 hours depending on traffic and road condition. Once at San Vicente, local transport is via tricycles, habal-habal, or small local vehicle rentals. Important details: entrance to Long Beach is generally free, though there may be small fees depending on exact access point. WiFi access is limited, and facilities/restaurants are modest—don’t expect luxury resorts all along the stretch.</p>

                <p>  The dry season (November to May) is the best for visiting Long Beach: clear skies, minimal rain, calm sea, good visibility. The months from March to May are often hottest. Rainy season (June to October) sees showers that may disrupt travel and reduce visibility, and some roads become harder to pass.</p>

                    <p>     Food in San Vicente is all about freshness and island simplicity. Most meals come straight from the sea think grilled fish, shrimp, crabs, or squid cooked right on the beach, often seasoned with just salt, garlic, and a squeeze of calamansi. Local eateries serve comforting Filipino favorites like adobo, sinigang, and kinilaw. If you’re feeling adventurous, try tamilok  a mangrove delicacy that locals proudly call their own best enjoyed with vinegar and a cold drink. For something sweet, grab a banana cue from a street stall or cool off with a glass of halo-halo. It’s the kind of food that feels homemade and full of heart  simple, fresh, and best eaten with your feet in the sand as the sun sets over Long Beach. </p>

                <header><h2>FUN FACT</h2></header>
                <p>      Long Beach is officially the country’s longest white-sand beach (around 14.7 km), and it's part of San Vicente’s Flagship Tourism Enterprise Zone, emphasizing eco-friendly and sustainable development. It’s divided by rocky cliffs at certain points, which adds scenic variety and opportunities to walk between sections during low tide.
    Watch out for sandflies especially early morning or dusk; jellyfish may appear in certain seasons, so swim carefully. Sun exposure can be strong — wear sun protection. Road safety is important if riding motorbikes; some roads are unpaved or rough. At night, visibility is low on many roads and there may be few streetlights. Always bring cash, as many vendors/restaurants don’t accept cards. Stay aware of tide schedules, especially if walking between rock sections.</p>
